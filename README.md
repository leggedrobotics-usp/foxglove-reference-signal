## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Sending a reference signal to your own control system in ROS2 has never been so simple. **foxglove-reference-signal** creates a compact [Foxglove](https://foxglove.dev/) panel with *Start* and *Stop* buttons for easily triggering the signal. With this extension, you can simultaneously send references to multiple systems or DOFs of a single system.

**foxglove-reference-signal** works as a companion extension for the [reference_signal_generator](https://github.com/leggedrobotics-usp/reference_signal_generator) ROS2 package, ensuring the best of both worlds:

- The simplicity and flexibility of Foxglove as the graphical user interface for your control system, responsible only for triggering the reference signal;
- The determinism and robustness of a ROS2 node, that is in charge of publishing the reference signal at the specified rate.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
This repo is a standard Foxglove extension, built according to the [create-foxglove-extension](https://github.com/foxglove/create-foxglove-extension) standard.

### üõ† Prerequisites

- [foxglove_bridge](https://github.com/foxglove/ros-foxglove-bridge)
    - Required to communicate ROS2 and Foxglove. Install using apt:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-foxglove-bridge
    ```

    - **Run** the bridge node whenever you want to connect Foxglove and the ROS2 network

    ```bash
    ros2 run foxglove_bridge foxglove_bridge
    ```

- [reference_signal_generator](https://github.com/leggedrobotics-usp/reference_signal_generator)
    - This ROS2 package is the "back-end" for **foxglove-reference-signal**, creating the standard topics and services that are in charge of generating the signals configured in the Foxglove interface.
    - After installing this package and its prerequisites, **run** the reference signal generator node. It will populate the corresponding topic and services. Make sure to select the correct topic name in the extension panel (default is */reference_signal*)

    ```bash
    ros2 run reference_signal_generator reference_signal_generator --ros-args -p topic_name:=<your_topic_name>
    ```

### üíª Installing

As mentioned above, this is a standard Foxglove extension. Thus, you can install it using *npm*:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leggedrobotics-usp/foxglove-reference-signal.git
cd foxglove-reference-signal
npm run local-install
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

<!-- Each instance of **foxglove-reference-signal** binds to a user-specified topic and creates multiple services for starting and stopping several different types of reference signals. Default topic name is **/reference_signal** and user can specify through command-line as follows:

```bash
ros2 run foxglove-reference-signal foxglove-reference-signal --ros-args -p topic_name:=<your_topic_name>
```

After starting the generator node, multiple services will be created to start and stop the reference signals. Use ``ros2 topic list`` to check them out. You must see:

- ``/<your_topic_name>/chirp`` Chirp (frequency-swept cosine)
- ``/<your_topic_name>/ramp`` Ramp
- ``/<your_topic_name>/sawtooth`` Rising-ramp sawtooth wave
- ``/<your_topic_name>/sine`` Sine wave
- ``/<your_topic_name>/square`` Square wave
- ``/<your_topic_name>/step`` Step
- ``/<your_topic_name>/triangle`` Triangle wave
- ``/<your_topic_name>/stop`` Used to stop a signal created by other service before its *total_time*

See [reference_signal_srvs](https://github.com/leggedrobotics-usp/reference_signal_srvs) for more details on each type of reference signal. -->
